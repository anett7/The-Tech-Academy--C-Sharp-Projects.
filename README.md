Student MVC: This is a project of a basic MVC application where MVC has defined default routes. Every Controller has a default route of Index, meaning if no method is specified after the controller name in the URL, it will default to Index.Furthermore, the root URL of the entire site has a default route of /Home/Index.

Newsletter App: This project is a fully functional MVC application, a signup to a newsletter form. Also I have created an admin page, that will display all the signups to the user.
